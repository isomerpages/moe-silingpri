The school is committed to nurturing “Future-ready and Responsible Digital Learners” under the vision of MOE’s ICT MasterPlan 4.

The ICT department serves to spearhead the school’s efforts in the integration of ICT into the curriculum to develop 21CC and nurturing of responsible citizens of the cyber world. We have unique ICT programmes that ensure our students’ well-being in the event of a school closure and it also develop them into lifelong technology-empowered learners.
