**FBL&nbsp;to**&nbsp;**to interactive Heritage Trail – Primary Five**  
  

Our Primary Five pupils went on an interactive Heritage Trail as part of their Social Studies field-based learning. Using ‘Jigsaw Strategy’, each class was split into three teams to explore and experience Kampong Glam, Little India and Chinatown simultaneously. Pupils were given the opportunity to make explicit meaningful connections between classroom experiences and the environment, using the affordances of wireless and mobile technologies.&nbsp;

At the end of the trail, the pupils returned to their class to share with their peers on the cultural and practices that they have learnt at each site. By engaging their senses of sight, touch and hearing through the trail, we hope the pupils can foster a greater sense of pride and belonging to our rich Singapore heritage.
