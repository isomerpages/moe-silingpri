### Character and Citizenship Education

In Si Ling, we adopt the&nbsp;**STEER**&nbsp;approach to develop the character and citizenship of our pupils which stands for&nbsp;**S**upport,&nbsp;**T**each,&nbsp;**E**nriching&nbsp;**E**xperience and&nbsp;**R**ecognition.

In line with the school's vision, we provide a caring and supportive environment to our pupils in order for maximum learning to take place. We believe in the saying 'Every Child Matters'.  

To inculcate the school's core values, we adopt the interdisciplinary approach where social emotional learning, 21st century competencies and NE messages are incorporated into the core &amp; non-core subjects.

For pupils to excercise and apply what they have learnt, we provide enriching experiences such as a wide range of CCAs and Values -in-Action activities.

Finally, we require the pupils to not only re-direct and reflect but also we recognise examplary behaviour and leadership excellence.
