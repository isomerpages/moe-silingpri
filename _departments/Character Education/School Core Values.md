### School Core Values

To align with our school mission “A Scholar Who Leads and Serves” and to refresh our school’s current set of six values, our school has streamlined them to the four core values of&nbsp;_**R**esilience,&nbsp;**I**ntegrity,&nbsp;**S**olidarity and&nbsp;**E**mpathy_&nbsp;(**R**.**I**.**S**.**E**).  

Our students will experience and learn to practise the R.I.S.E. values through their daily lessons and specific programmes such as the National Education curriculum, Values-In-Action Programmes, the Student Leadership Programmes and Student Development Experience Activities such as Outdoor Adventure Learning, Cohort Camps and Learning Journeys.

Through R.I.S.E., we wish to emphasise the importance of internalising and living out of these core values for service and leadership development as a scholar.

**Interclass Championship The Solidarity Program**

The Interclass Championship was introduced to promote our school values, Solidarity, to our students. They are required to work together as a class and achieve certain milestones via different programs conducted by the different departments in the school. Students will garner points in terms of participation in programs and points for winning events such as classroom cleanliness, decoration efforts, class recycling programs and many more competitions. Solidarity&nbsp; program not only encourages our students to work as a united front, it also models this behaviour as Teachers and departments of the school integrate as a united force to instill the value of Solidarity.&nbsp; 

**Values Mural Mall**

Every term, teachers nominate pupils for displaying the school values and for being a good role model for the other pupils.&nbsp; 

A panel of teachers and student leaders then choose one pupil from each level and these pupils’ details will be put up on our school’s Value Mural Wall. Certificates are also given to these pupils during assembly.
