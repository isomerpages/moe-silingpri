<h3><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h3>
<p>In line with our school’s vision –&nbsp;<strong>Every Si Ling Student a Scholar who Leads and Serves</strong>,
our school places a strong emphasis to develop every Si Ling pupil with
the relevant leadership skills to lead oneself as well as others based
on their leadership aptitude and interests.</p>

<h5>Level 1: Self Leadership</h5>
<p>All Si Ling students learn self-leadership skills through our ‘Leaders
of Self’ (LoS) Series during Assembly to be equipped as Level 1 ‘Leaders
of Self and Values’ and Peer Supporters.</p>
<h5>Level 2: Basic Leadership</h5>
<p>Our Level 2 task-specific Student Leaders are selected and trained on
their task-specific roles by the respective teachers-in-charge to build
on their basic leadership skills. For instance, the Class Monitors and
ICT monitors are trained by the Student Leadership Committee and ICT department
respectively. All other class operations monitors are trained by their
subject teachers with the use of the school’s ‘Guide for Classroom Leadership’.
To encourage more opportunities for all pupils, these Level 2 leadership
roles are rotated either termly or semestrally.</p>
<h5>Level 3: Advanced Leadership</h5>
<p>All Level 3 Student leaders are trained by the Student Leadership Committee
to hone their advanced leadership skills. A selected group of these Student
Leaders form the ‘Special-Projects Committee’ where they take charge of
the planning and execution of student-led activities like the Students’
Voice Online Forum and Students’ Suggestion Scheme (SSS). They also assist
in school-level programmes like the planning of Teachers’ Day.</p>
<h5>Level 4: Outstanding Leadership</h5>
<p>Besides undergoing the same training sessions as the Level 3 Student Leaders,
our Level 4 Student Leaders also go through basic mentoring sessions to
further hone their outstanding leadership skills. This also guides them
to be positive influence and mentors to other students and Student Leaders
under their charge.</p>
<p>Our Student Leadership Programme is anchored on&nbsp;<strong>The Leadership Challenge®</strong>&nbsp;that
is adopted from&nbsp;<strong>“The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership"</strong>&nbsp;by
Kouzes and Posner.</p>
