<h3><strong>Discipline</strong></h3>
<h5>Discipline Policy</h5>
<p>Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time,
they need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve.
To this end, the school adopts a Positive Discipline/ Behaviour Support
model towards developing self-discipline and good character in our students,
and equipping them with the necessary social and emotional skills to behave
thoughtfully and be responsible and respectful individuals.</p>
<p>Through promoting a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care,
challenging behaviour are prevented from occurring. Inappropriate behavior
are addressed promptly and corrected before it affects students’ development
and well-being. Inappropriate behavior are replaced with prosocial, appropriate
ones and in the process, relationships are restored between all parties
involved.</p>
<p>Adhering closely to MOE’s philosophy on discipline, the school has distilled
and formulated an intertwined 3 ringed approach to discipline, with each
ring representing the approaches and partnership which the school takes
towards building discipline in students.</p>
