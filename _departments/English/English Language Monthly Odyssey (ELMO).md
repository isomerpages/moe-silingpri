English Language Monthly Odyssey (ELMO) is an array of literacy-based activities that aims to make language learning more enjoyable, engaging and rewarding. 

Literacy is important for the 21st Century native since it will determine not only the acquisition of knowledge and skills but also in learning social behaviour, and in their ability to connect with others. By making EL learning exciting, students are more willing to participate and often find the lesson fun and memorable.

Activities such as creating podcast can help students express their thoughts more clearly in real-life scenarios. Role play using costumes allows students to be creative and to put themselves in another person's perspective. However, due to the pandemic, teachers came up with innovative ways to engage participation in ELMO.

Understanding that students love technology, the teacher leverage on it to design online activities that are aligned to topics taught in the classroom. For example, an online Words Juxtapose on idioms were posted in SLS to enrich students’ vocabulary. Students found ELMO activities interesting as they can apply vocabulary and skills learnt in the classroom by expressing themselves in a fun-filled, relaxed environment.
