<p>The English Department sparked excitement for the love of English by launching
the Spelling Bee competition. Students from Primary 2 till Primary 6 gathered
to showcase their spelling skills. With hearts racing and minds focused,
students bravely spelled out the words one by one.</p>

<p>As the rounds went on, the tension rose, but so did the excitement. Each
correct spelling was met with cheers and applause from their fellow classmates.
Though there could only be one winner per level, every participant received
recognition for their effort and courage.</p>

<p>In the end, amidst the cheers, the champion emerged, but the spirit of
teamwork and learning prevailed above all else. The Spelling Bee was not
just about winning; it was about coming together as a school community
to celebrate language and hard work.</p>
