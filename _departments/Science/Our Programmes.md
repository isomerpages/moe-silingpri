### **Our Programmes**

We believe in designing a rich experience of learning that fosters joy of learning in students, providing them with opportunities to acquire knowledge and skills, while having fun and with the necessary rigor.

##### Grow me
Students have the opportunity to demonstrate the school’s values – perseverance and respect, as they patiently and lovingly wait for their seeds or caterpillar to reach the adult stage.  They hone their observation and communication skills as they record and present the growth of their ‘pets’.  They are also able to see the water cycle in action as they build their terrarium.

##### Learning Trails
Our learning trails provide our students the opportunity to be out of the classroom to see the facts they read about in their textbooks. They are also able to apply concepts and skills to authentic contexts, and learn and think independently through self-exploration and observation, deepening their learning.

##### Young Scientist Magazine

To promote better learning of Science, we introduce the Young Scientist Magazine to students.

This encourages them to read beyond their textbooks. Students can pick up these magazines in the comfort of their own classes and explore the wonders of science through reading.  We aim to arouse students’ interest in science as they read how science influences most aspects of everyday life.
