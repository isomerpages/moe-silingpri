### **P.A.L.M. Play and Learn Math**

Our mathematics programme and events are organised to arouse interest in pupils in the learning of mathematics. These programme allows pupils to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. At the same time, they also see the application of mathematics in real authentic situation which motivates them to learn mathematics.  
  
The play and learn mathematics (PALM) programme get pupils to apply their mathematical concepts in projects. Pupils develop 21 CC skills through planning, crafting and designing these projects.

| Level | Project |
| :--------: | -------- |
| P1     | Pupils write a mathematical story/poem/jingle. They apply what they learnt on addition and subtraction to write mathematical stories.     |
| P2     | Pupils weigh the flour and measure the amount of water to make the dough before writing a recipe on making the pizza.     |
| P3     | Before going to the Zoo for their learning journey, pupils plan an itinerary for a day at the Zoo using what they have learnt in the topic time.     |
| P4     | Pupils design and create a mathematics game using any mathematical concepts they have learnt.     |
| P5     | Pupils create a video to teach a mathematical concept to their friends.     |
| P6     | Pupils design and create a mathematics trail in school for their primary 5 peers.     |

#### Learning Journey
One of the best ways to broaden our minds is to travel and be exposed to the world.&nbsp; Learning journey encourage pupils to learn not only through the classroom but also through experiential learning, giving them the chance to break out of their academic routine.

#### Mathematics Trail (Primary 1-6)
Mathematics Trail is an interactive way to learn mathematics beyond the classroom and textbooks. Using mathematics trail, pupils can see and experience mathematics concepts that are applied in their daily activities and things around them. Through the use of iPads, pupils are able to move about answering questions using the camera function, recording of video to answer and explain their answers. They also engaged in cooperative learning as they work collaboratively to complete the assigned tasks.

#### Math Fun Week
Math fun week is held annually to engage pupils with fun-filled mathematics activities.&nbsp; Pupils get to investigate and apply mathematics concepts through the problems created for them to develop their reasoning and critical thinking skills! Pupils were given opportunities to explain to their classmates how they derived their answers.

In addition to the activity in the classroom, there were activities in Student Learning Space (SLS) for the different level to demonstrate their creativity. Learning Math is fun!&nbsp;  

Here are some of the works of the students.

*Primary 1: Making patterns using shapes/ pictures.*
