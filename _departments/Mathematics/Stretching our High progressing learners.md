<h3><strong>Stretching our High-Progressing Learners</strong></h3>
<p>In Si Ling, high-progressing learners can participate in enrichment programmes
and activities that ignite their interests in Mathematics and develop their
reasoning and communication skills.</p>
<h4>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme</h4>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme,&nbsp;developed by the Israel Centre for
Excellence through Education (ICEE),&nbsp;aims to develop students' mathematical
reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an
inquiry approach.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate
with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through Mathematical
puzzles and games. These rich learning experiences will develop the habits,
attitudes and dispositions that mathematicians possess as well as 21st
century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and
effective communication skills.</p>
<h4>Math H.O.T Programme</h4>
<p>The mathematical olympiad workshop is organized for our Primary 3 to 6
pupils. This workshop exposes pupils to higher order thinking (HOT) questions
and equip them with strategies on how to solve challenging problems.</p>
<p>Through the workshop, pupils will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>understand and appreciate the different problem-solving techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>solve different types of primary mathematical olympiad questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply the best techniques on a given problem with more confidence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Math Competitions</h4>
<p>Pupils are encouraged to participate in the following mathematics competitions.
These competitions provide a platform for pupils to demonstrate their mathematics
skills learnt and also motivate them to strive for excellence in the learning
of mathematics.</p>
