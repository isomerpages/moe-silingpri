<h3><strong>Curriculum and Approach</strong></h3>
<p>Our school aligns our mathematics curricular approach with the broad aims
of mathematics education in Singapore to enable students to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop cognitive and metacognitive skills through a mathematical&nbsp;approach
to problem solving; and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop positive attitudes towards mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>We achieve this by designing our math programme into 3 phases, with a
focus on building strong foundation in the subject right from the start.</p>

<h5><strong>Some of our common approaches:</strong></h5>
<h5>1. Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Approach</h5>
<p>The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (CPA) is used in the teaching
of mathematics. Lessons are designed using the CPA sequence to foster deeper
understanding of mathematical concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Concrete</strong>&nbsp;is the “doing” stage. During this stage,
students use concrete objects to model problems.</p>
<p><strong>Pictorial</strong>&nbsp;is the “seeing” stage. Here, visual representations
of concrete objects are used to model problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>&nbsp;is the “symbolic” stage, where children
use abstract symbols to model problems.</p>

<h5>2. BEST Approach to Problem Solving</h5>
<p>The Polya’s 4-step problem solving process was adapted and we called it
the BEST approach to problem solving. This approach focus on metacognition
which is thinking about thinking, refers to the awareness of, and the ability
to control one’s thinking processes. This approach provides a structured
development to pupils’ thinking process as they solve the word problem.</p>
<h5>3. Model Method</h5>
<p>The model method is used for effective mathematics learning and problem
solving. The drawing of model helps our pupils understand complex mathematical
word problems. It helps pupils to develop and enhance pupils’ mathematical
thinking and problem solving in the early years of mathematical education.</p>
<h5>4. Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)</h5>
<p>In Si Ling, we embarked on the ICAN programme by the Ministry of Education
(Curriculum Planning and Development Division) to enhance the teaching
and learning of mathematics. ICAN uses intervention strategies guided by
research to address 4 key issues namely learning gaps, language, motivation
and memory.</p>
