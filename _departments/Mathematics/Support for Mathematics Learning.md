<h3><strong>Support for Mathematics Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Every student is important to us. Our school pays close attention and
provides support for pupils who may need more time to grasp mathematical
concepts. Interventions are done at the early stage of learning so that
learning gaps could be bridged early.</p>
<h4>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</h4>
<p>Learning support for mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention effort
aimed at providing additional support to pupils who do not have foundational
numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 and Primary 2 Mathematics
curriculum.</p>
