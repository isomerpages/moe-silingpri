<h2>Teachers in Action</h2>

Driven by our school’s mission “to nurture our pupils to be their best”, our teachers are dedicated to attaining excellence in their craft. This ethos underpins the professional development of teachers within Si Ling Primary School.

In our school, we have designated weekly Professional Development Time to facilitate collaboration among teachers who are teaching the same subject and grade level, enabling them to work together in designing captivating lessons that are then put into practice in their respective classrooms. 

Following these lessons, teachers convene to reflect on their teaching experiences and evaluate student progress. This cyclical process occurs throughout the academic year, enabling teachers to capitalize on each other's insights and instructional materials.
Furthermore, teachers participate in Open Classroom sessions, where they welcome colleagues to observe their lessons and provide feedback or engage as observers in their peers' classes, offering constructive insights.

At the culmination of the academic year, our school hosts a "Celebration of Learning" event, during which teachers showcase and share their innovative teaching practices. In contrast to the structured Professional Development Time sessions, this event encourages cross-disciplinary learning, allowing teachers to explore and potentially adapt practices from different subjects.


Our teachers also actively share with teachers from other schools through national platforms such as Teachers’ Conference and Excel Fest, Academy of Singapore Teachers’ Teacher-Led Workshops and Singapore Learning Designers Circle and Zonal platforms such as North Zone Open Classrooms.
