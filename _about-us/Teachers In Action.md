<h2>Teachers in Action</h2>

<p>Driven by our school’s mission “to nurture our pupils to be their best”,
our teachers are dedicated to attaining excellence in their craft. This
ethos underpins the professional development of teachers within Si Ling
Primary School.</p>

<p>In our school, we have designated weekly Professional Development Time
to facilitate collaboration among teachers who are teaching the same subject
and grade level, enabling them to work together in designing captivating
lessons that are then put into practice in their respective classrooms.</p>

<p>Following these lessons, teachers convene to reflect on their teaching
experiences and evaluate student progress. This cyclical process occurs
throughout the academic year, enabling teachers to capitalize on each other's
insights and instructional materials.</p>

<p>Furthermore, teachers participate in Open Classroom sessions, where they
welcome colleagues to observe their lessons and provide feedback or engage
as observers in their peers' classes, offering constructive insights.</p>

</div>
<p>At the culmination of the academic year, our school hosts a "Celebration
of Learning" event, during which teachers showcase and share their innovative
teaching practices. In contrast to the structured Professional Development
Time sessions, this event encourages cross-disciplinary learning, allowing
teachers to explore and potentially adapt practices from different subjects.</p>

<p>Our teachers also actively share with teachers from other schools through
national platforms such as Teachers’ Conference and Excel Fest, Academy
of Singapore Teachers’ Teacher-Led Workshops and Singapore Learning Designers
Circle and Zonal platforms such as North Zone Open Classrooms.</p></div>
