**Dear Parents/Guardians**,

Si Ling Primary School is a school of rich heritage. From our humble beginnings as a school at the junction of Admiralty Road and Marsiling Lane, on the site of a rubber plantation, we have evolved and developed through the years to be a vibrant learning community.

We want our students to achieve their potential and live their aspirations, while embracing strong values to guide them in lives. Over the years, our students only excel not just academically, but also in all other areas like Leadership, Sports and Games, Co-curricular Activities, and Service to the Community. After graduating, many of them continue to distinguish themselves in many fields. 

A school culture of care and excellence is what drives us to keep reinventing our programme to ensure relevance to our students in this fast changing world. We instill growth mindset in our students so that they understand the values of effort and persistence in improving the level and frequency of their achievements.

We would like to invite you to partner us in the exciting growing years of your childâ€™s schooling life. Let us work alongside you to develop the future leaders of our nation.

Mr Koe Ee Tiong<br>
Principal<br>
