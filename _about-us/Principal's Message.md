### Principal's Message

**Dear Parents/Guardians**,

I am delighted to welcome you back as we begin a new term together. It is wonderful to see our school community reunited and ready for the year ahead.

A new term brings fresh beginnings and new opportunities. To our students — whether you are returning or joining us for the first time — this is a new chapter. As you start the term, we encourage you to approach your learning with **resilience**, staying positive and persevering even when challenges arise.

At our school, learning goes beyond the classroom. It happens when we act with **integrity** — doing the right thing even when no one is watching — and when we show **empathy**, caring for and respecting one another in our words and actions. It also grows through **solidarity**, as we support our friends, classmates, and teammates, and move forward together as one community.

I would like to acknowledge our teachers, whose dedication and commitment create a supportive and nurturing environment for our students. Their guidance helps our students grow not only academically, but also in character.

As we embark on this new term, let us live out our values each day — in our classrooms, CCAs, on the sports field, and in our interactions with one another. Together, let us continue to build a school where everyone feels supported, respected, and inspired to do their best.

I wish everyone a meaningful, fulfilling, and successful term ahead. Thank you.

Mr Koe Ee Tiong<br>
