### Principal's Message

**Dear Parents/Guardians**,

We concluded 2024 on a high note, with the school achieving remarkable success. The PSLE results from the past two years have been a great source of encouragement! In 2024, many of our students excelled and earned spots in their preferred secondary schools. This accomplishment is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the unwavering support of our students’ families.

Our students have not only excelled in their studies but also on the sports field and in their various CCAs. They have embraced challenges, supported each other with kindness, and celebrated one another’s achievements. Each of them has contributed to making our school a better place!

The passion, innovation, and dedication of our teachers have fostered an environment where students are motivated to give their best.

Let us continue to collaborate in inspiring our students and celebrating their successes. I am looking forward to the new adventures and opportunities that lie ahead.

Mr Koe Ee Tiong<br>
