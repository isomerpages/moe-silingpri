Principal’s Message 2022  

A very warm welcome to Si Ling Primary School. 

Our school motto, Strive for Progress, reflects the strong commitment of our teachers and the school community in nurturing every child to attain their full potential. The vibrancy of our curricular programme, as well as the pupils’ achievements in the various aspects of learning, are testament to the unwavering dedication of our teachers and staff.

  

In their six years of education with us, we surround our pupils with the school’s affirmative and caring culture, providing them with encouragement and the space to discover their own unique strengths and abilities. We achieve this through a holistic school curriculum, and a well-balanced approach towards teaching and learning. In our mission to nurture our pupils to be their best, we provide a holistic curriculum which includes our SLP Signature Programmes for EL, Mathematics, Environmental Science, Community and Student Leadership, as well as student development. We are proud of our robust programme, which provides our pupils with an enriching Si Ling Primary schooling experience.

  

As a result, our pupils grow and flourish in their learning, and develop a strong sense of belonging to the school, their family, their community and the nation.  

  

We would like to invite you to partner us in these exciting growing years of your child’s schooling life. Let us work alongside you to develop the future leaders of our nation.

  

Mr Koe Ee Tiong
