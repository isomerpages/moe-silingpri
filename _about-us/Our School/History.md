### History

Si Ling Primary School stood at the junction of Admiralty Road and Marsiling Lane, on the site of a rubber plantation which was leveled in 1978. Si Ling Primary School opened its doors to students on 2 January 1980 at 9 Marsiling Lane. It was officially opened on 28 August 1981 by the then Minister for Education, Dr Tony Tan.

Si Ling Primary School started a new chapter in its history when it was relocated to its current site, 61 Woodlands Ave 1, on 8 December 2001. The move was in line with MOE’s PRIME Project. The new building which boasts of better facilities and more space, is now home to about 1004 pupils. With these new and better facilities, the school is better able to cope with the rapid chang es in education today and meet the many challenges ahead.

Over the years, the school has been led by six Principals, Mr Tan How Thye, Mr Stephen Goh, Miss Rosalind Chia Peck Lan, Mdm Teo Woo Mee, Mr A Sivam Reddy and Mr Lim Chew Hiong Richard. Mr Koe Ee Tiong, the present Principal, was posted to the school in December 2018. Mr Koe is assisted by our Vice-Principals, Mdm Nurazian Bajuri and Ms Chee Yeung Wai.

Si Ling Primary School seeks to educate every pupil to work hard and give his/her best at work and play. It seeks to instill in every student the school's core values of **R**esilience, **I**ntegrity, **S**olidarity and **E**mpathy (**R.I.S.E**). The school policy reflects the ideals in the Desired Outcomes of Education and translates them into practical steps that each child may apply in his/her quest for excellence.

True to its vision, Si Ling Primary School will make every effort to develop strong and effective partnership with parents, alumni and other stakeholders in its pursuit of being the school of choice in Woodlands for its holistic education and caring environment. The school’s mission is to nurture its pupils to be thinking learners and gracious citizens, moulding them to be future leaders of the nation. Si Ling Primary School will continue to develop quality teaching professionals in order for them to help our pupils realize their fullest potential.

Over the years, the school has taken on the role of moulding our pupils to become useful citizens of Singapore, able to find their niche in society. This would not have been possible without the hard work of teachers and support from parents.
