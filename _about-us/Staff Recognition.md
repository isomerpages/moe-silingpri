<p>We are proud to share that a group of our teachers have been nominated for the President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) 2025 and the Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA) 2025 – two of the most prestigious national accolades that honour exemplary educators in Singapore.

These nominations are a recognition of their unwavering dedication, innovative teaching practices, and their deep commitment to nurturing every pupil to be a confident learner and contributing member of society. Beyond the classroom, they inspire others through professional sharing, mentoring, and collaborative leadership, embodying the true spirit of the teaching profession.</p>
