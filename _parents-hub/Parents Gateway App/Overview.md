### Parents Gateway App

**MOE’s Parents Gateway Mobile App**

<img src="/images/Parents'%20Hub/Parents'%20Gateway%20App/pga1.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> Our school will communicate with parents through MOE’s Parents Gateway (PG) Mobile App, a digital platform developed by Ministry of Education and GovTech. With the free app, parents will be able to receive timely information about school activities/events (e.g. enrichment, CCA, etc) via push notification. In addition, you can also give consent for your child’s activities via the app.

If you have children in different schools, you will be able to receive notifications on the same PG App. Parents can download the PG App individually to receive notices.

You will need to download the PG app onto your mobile phone (available on iOS and Andriod platforms) and do a one-time registration (refer to Instructional Guide for the step-by-step guide). Please note that the login is via SingPass. If you are unable to access the PG App, please inform your child’s Form Teacher and he/she will assist you.
