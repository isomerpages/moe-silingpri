<h3>Cyber Wellness</h3>
<p>To complement the cyber wellness curriculum in schools, parents can set
a good example at home in the use of technology and play an active role
in guiding our children to navigate in cyberspace.&nbsp; Here are the steps
for&nbsp;<strong>PARENT</strong>ing in the digital age:</p>
<p><strong>Provide opportunities for a variety of offline activities</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spend time with your child by carrying out family
activities such as sports and outdoor activities so that your child has
a healthy and balanced lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Activate parental controls in all computing devices</strong>
</p>
<p>To setup parental controls in Apple devices:</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Turn On The&nbsp;<strong>iPad's Restrictions</strong>.
Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>General</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Restrictions</strong>&nbsp;and
tap&nbsp;<strong>Enable Restrictions.</strong>&nbsp;Every time you do this
you'll be asked to set a 4-digit passcode and enter it a second time. Be
sure it's something you can remember but your kid won't figure out.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Role-model good digital habits</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Manage your own digital habits such as avoiding extensive
use of technology and avoiding use of technology during meal times.</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Show your child safe, responsible and respectful behaviour
when sharing, collaborating and creating online.</p>
<p><strong>Establish the ground rules for internet use</strong>
</p>
<p>Some basic rules could include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Dos:</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; seek permission before using computing devices</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; have a time limit for the use of computing devices</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; practice netiquette on the Internet</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; respect intellectual property right</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; follow rules and terms of use of different websites</p>
<p><strong>Don't:</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Access websites that have age restrictions (for e.g. many
social media sites have age limit for setting up accounts to comply with
international regulations on children accessing social media).</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; share password with others</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; share personal information online</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; meet strangers face to face without parents’ knowledge</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; spread rumours and say mean things online</p>
<p><strong>Navigate the internet with your child to understand his/her user</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Surf the Internet with your child so that you know what
he/she does online and whether he/she is involved in age-appropriate activities.
This will help to hone your child’s skills to translate his/her understanding
into actions which he/she can later apply should he/she face similar situations.</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Highlight to your child not to respond to anyone who says
something inappropriate and he/she should immediately leave any site if
he/she feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Access websites that have age restrictions (for e.g. many
social media sites have age limit for setting up accounts to comply with
international regulations on children accessing social media).</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; share password with others</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;share personal information online</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; meet strangers face to face without parents’ knowledge</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; spread rumours and say mean things online</p>
<p><strong>Talk with your child about his/her internet use</strong>
</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Get your child to share with you his/her favourite online
websites, things he/she do online and what is cool amongst his/her friends.</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Talk to him/her about his/her online experiences. (For
example, discuss about the benefits and risks of the Internet, share how
people connect and communicate with one another through the Internet).</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Let your child know that it is alright to ask you questions
or talk to you if he/she run into problems with someone online.</p>
<p>o&nbsp; &nbsp; Download the C-Quest game app, which facilitates conversation
between parents and children on cyber wellness, from the iTunes Store /
Google Play.</p>
