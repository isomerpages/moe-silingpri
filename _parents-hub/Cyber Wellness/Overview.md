### Cyber Wellness

To complement the cyber wellness curriculum in schools, parents can set a good example at home in the use of technology and play an active role in guiding our children to navigate in cyberspace.  Here are the steps for **PARENT**ing in the digital age:  
  

**P****rovide opportunities for a variety of offline activities**

o    Spend time with your child by carrying out family activities such as sports and outdoor activities so that your child has a healthy and balanced lifestyle.  

**Activate parental controls in all computing devices**

To setup parental controls in Apple devices:

  

o    Turn On The **iPad's Restrictions**. Go to **Settings** \> **General** \> **Restrictions** and tap **Enable Restrictions.** Every time you do this you'll be asked to set a 4-digit passcode and enter it a second time. Be sure it's something you can remember but your kid won't figure out.  

o  For more information, please visit [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201304)

**R****ole-model good digital habits**

o    Manage your own digital habits such as avoiding extensive use of technology and avoiding use of technology during meal times.  

o    Show your child safe, responsible and respectful behaviour when sharing, collaborating and creating online.  

  

**E****stablish the ground rules for internet use**

Some basic rules could include the following:  
  

**Dos:**

o    seek permission before using computing devices

o    have a time limit for the use of computing devices

o    practice netiquette on the Internet

o    respect intellectual property right

o    follow rules and terms of use of different websites

  

**Don't:**

o    Access websites that have age restrictions (for e.g. many social media sites have age limit for setting up accounts to comply with international regulations on children accessing social media).

o    share password with others

o    share personal information online

o    meet strangers face to face without parents’ knowledge

o    spread rumours and say mean things online

**N****avigate the internet with your child to understand his/her user**

o    Surf the Internet with your child so that you know what he/she does online and whether he/she is involved in age-appropriate activities. This will help to hone your child’s skills to translate his/her understanding into actions which he/she can later apply should he/she face similar situations.  

o    Highlight to your child not to respond to anyone who says something inappropriate and he/she should immediately leave any site if he/she feel uncomfortable.  

o    Access websites that have age restrictions (for e.g. many social media sites have age limit for setting up accounts to comply with international regulations on children accessing social media).  

o    share password with others  

o    share personal information online

o    meet strangers face to face without parents’ knowledge  

o    spread rumours and say mean things online  

**Talk with your child about his/her internet use**

o    Get your child to share with you his/her favourite online websites, things he/she do online and what is cool amongst his/her friends.

o    Talk to him/her about his/her online experiences. (For example, discuss about the benefits and risks of the Internet, share how people connect and communicate with one another through the Internet).

o    Let your child know that it is alright to ask you questions or talk to you if he/she run into problems with someone online.  

o    Download the C-Quest game app, which facilitates conversation between parents and children on cyber wellness, from the iTunes Store / Google Play.
