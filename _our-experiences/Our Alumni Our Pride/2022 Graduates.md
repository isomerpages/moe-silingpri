I have made many friends along my journey in Si Ling Primary School. I'm still in contact with some of them through WhatsApp.
My proudest moment as a student in Si Ling Primary School was when I got my PSLE result because I was really surprised that I did very well.

I would not have been able to perform well without the help and support of my teachers, peers and family.
Si Ling Primary School has provided me with many opportunities for me to develop myself, such as ‘I am a Young Entrepreneur’ and Sports Day. These activities developed me holistically."

<img src="/images/About%20Us/juhi%20vora%20picture.png" style="width:200px;height:180px; margin-right:15px;" align="left">&nbsp;"Throughout my wonderful journey in SLPS, not only did I pick up many moral values and life skills along the way but I also fully enjoyed myself at every moment of it. I had very supportive friends and my teachers were very helpful. 

They would always be ready to help me clear my doubts, even after school. SLPS also gives its students many opportunities to nurture them to become Scholars who Lead and Serve through its meaningful activities such as camps and other character development programmes. 

I am sure that every student will thrive in Si Ling Primary School's friendly and nurturing environment and lastly, I would like to say that I am very grateful to  SLPS  for teaching me to strive to be the best that I can be."
