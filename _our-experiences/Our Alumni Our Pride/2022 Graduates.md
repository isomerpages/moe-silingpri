I have made many friends along my journey in Si Ling Primary School. I'm still in contact with some of them through WhatsApp.
My proudest moment as a student in Si Ling Primary School was when I got my PSLE result because I was really surprised that I did very well.

I would not have been able to perform well without the help and support of my teachers, peers and family.
Si Ling Primary School has provided me with many opportunities for me to develop myself, such as ‘I am a Young Entrepreneur’ and Sports Day. These activities developed me holistically."
