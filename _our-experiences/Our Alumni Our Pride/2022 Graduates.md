<img src="/images/alumni%20pictures%20(3).png" style="width:200px;height:180px;margin-right:15px;" align="left">&nbsp;"My experience as a student here was amazing! The teachers, friends and non-teaching staff here were really kind and helpful. 

I have made many friends along my journey in Si Ling Primary School. I'm still in contact with some of them through WhatsApp.
My proudest moment as a student in Si Ling Primary School was when I got my PSLE result because I was really surprised that I did very well.

I would not have been able to perform well without the help and support of my teachers, peers and family.
Si Ling Primary School has provided me with many opportunities for me to develop myself, such as ‘I am a Young Entrepreneur’ and Sports Day. These activities developed me holistically."

<img src="/images/About%20Us/juhi%20vora%20picture.png" style="width:200px;height:180px; margin-right:15px;" align="left">&nbsp;"Throughout my wonderful journey in SLPS, not only did I pick up many moral values and life skills along the way but I also fully enjoyed myself at every moment of it. I had very supportive friends and my teachers were very helpful. 

They would always be ready to help me clear my doubts, even after school. SLPS also gives its students many opportunities to nurture them to become Scholars who Lead and Serve through its meaningful activities such as camps and other character development programmes. 

I am sure that every student will thrive in Si Ling Primary School's friendly and nurturing environment and lastly, I would like to say that I am very grateful to  SLPS  for teaching me to strive to be the best that I can be."

&nbsp;"There were many beautiful memories that I have made in SLPS. One of them was on Graduation Day.I took part in all the games and had so much fun.

I was provided with several new and exciting opportunities. I would like to thank all the teachers who have taught me since I joined the Si Ling family. 

They not only helped me academically but also instilled good values, such as perseverance and solidarity, which helped me become a better person. They have always believed in me and guided me patiently. Even though my journey in Si Ling has come to an end, I will always cherish the memories and experiences I had there."

&nbsp;"I had a fun and enriching time in SLPS. Si Ling Primary School is my second home where I hold good memories. From good friends to good teachers, I know I can always depend on Si along if I encounter any difficulties.
I made lasting friendships. 

In fact, my best friend is in the same school and class as me. I do have all of my friends’ contact numbers and have a group chat with them. We also meet up during the holidays.
My proudest moment in SLPS was when I got to lead the Prefects Investiture along with the other Assistant Head Prefect, the Deputy Head Prefect and the Head Prefect. 

It gave me a sense of responsibility and to be a good role model to my peers.
Si Ling Primary School helped me hone my leadership skills. It helped me find the potential in me. Si Ling also taught me many invaluable life lessons and values which are still useful for secondary school and for my future."

&nbsp;"My experience as a student has been quite fulfilling. I made many lasting friendships, and we even created a group chat with everyone in our class in it. There were many caring teachers who were always there for me throughout my journey in Si Ling Primary School.

Si Ling Primary School allowed me to develop leadership qualities as I had been a prefect for 3 years, it also allowed me to be more caring towards others.
A defining moment in Si Ling Primary School which helped me realise what I wanted to be when I grew up was when I first found out that I had a knack for math. So, at that time, I started to love math and I loved studying. So, at that moment, I wanted to be an engineer when I grew up."

&nbsp;"One memorable experience that I had as a student in SLPS was during the P5 camp. We learnt how to pitch a tent, went to Sembawang Park and bonded together as a class . I made long lasting memories with my friends. We are still in touch with each other in a Class Group chat.

My proudest moment in SLPS was when I performed for Recognition Day.  I performed with the other P6 students and showcased our skills of drumming that we learn as part of Post PSLE activities.
My love for Maths blossomed further when I was selected to participate in the  Math Olympiad. It was truly a wonderful opportunity."

&nbsp;"My experience as a student in Si Ling Primary School was very fulfilling and exciting. I made many memories with my friends and teachers, especially after PSLE. My proudest moment was when I became the Assistant Head Prefect. I was given many opportunities to develop myself as a leader. I led my peers and planned events for the school like Teachers Day.

&nbsp;"When I was a student in Si Ling Primary School, the school organised many fantastic activities to promote good values and enrichment programmes for the students. Si Ling Primary School has provided me many opportunities to hone my strengths and love for the Chinese Language, such as the  Calligraphy and Recital competitions to develop me holistically. During my time in Si Ling Primary School, I realised that I want to be  a doctor when I grow up.There are just too many beautiful memories in Si Ling Primary School and I will definitely keep them close to my heart."

&nbsp;"My friends and I still keep in touch with one another in our class WhatsApp Group Chat. My proudest moment as a student in Si Ling Primary was when I got my first award for Recognition Day in Primary 3 for the Most Improved Award'. It was also my first time getting on the stage in the School Hall. 
One beautiful memory I had in Si Ling Primary was the trip to the Singapore Discovery Centre after PSLE. Over there, there were many fun and exciting activities like Laser Tag and the Escape Room. We also learnt about Singapore's history after all the games."

&nbsp;"Overall, my experience as a student in Si Ling was very enjoyable. Although it was quite stressful and overwhelming at times, I was able to get through challenges with the support of my family, teachers and schoolmates. I am still in contact with my old school friends. In fact, I contact them nearly every day! 

My proudest moments in Si Ling were definitely when I received my PSLE results and when I won in the 2 mins of fame in P6. I certainly did not expect it! 
Si Ling provided many opportunities for me to develop such as many group activities for me to be able to learn how to work better with others. 
Throughout my 6 years in Si Ling, I have made many beautiful memories. 

Especially in my last year. I think I really opened up more in P6. At one point, I questioned myself about my fears. I asked myself why I was so afraid and when I thought about it, the reasons suddenly seemed so trivial and frivolous. So, I started becoming a little more confident and I was even able to make more friends."
