##### Our Mission

**_Development of skills and competencies_**

At the&nbsp;**_Exposure_**&nbsp;level, all students are exposed to various forms of the arts, through assembly talks, learning journeys and concert trips. Following the aesthetics’ themes by terms, teachers arrange appropriate assembly talks, performances, art jamming during recess and interactive aesthetic games.

At the&nbsp;**_Experience_**&nbsp;level, students go through a broad-based art and music curriculum based on the five overarching learning objectives&nbsp;that is progressive in the classroom and across different disciplines.

Through the learning and appreciation of art and music, students develop inquiry skills which enables them to observe and perceive their world with increased awareness and aesthetic sensitivity which lays the foundation for students’ lifelong appreciation and interest in the arts.

At the&nbsp;**_Excellence_**&nbsp;level, students are given platforms and opportunities to showcase their talents through school-based and external performances and competitions. Following the aesthetics’ themes by terms, teachers plan Showtime@Recess performances, virtual showcases and 2 Minutes of Fame Competitions.&nbsp;

Based on these three Es, the curriculum, programmes and activities are crafted around the theme of:

*   **Self &amp; My Environment**
*   **Singapore Past, Present &amp; Future**
*   **The World &amp; Around Me**  

##### Vision

Our students will be&nbsp;**competent&nbsp;artistE3s**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**appreciative audience**&nbsp;of the arts.

We believe that a vibrant aesthetics environment provides our students exposure to various forms of arts through progressive platforms, thus enabling our students to be more appreciative of their work and that of others.
