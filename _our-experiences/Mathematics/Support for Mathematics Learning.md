### Support for Mathematics Learning

Every student is important to us. Our school pays close attention and provides support for pupils who may need more time to grasp mathematical concepts. Interventions are done at the early stage of learning so that learning gaps could be bridged early.

**1. Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)**

Learning support for mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to pupils who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 and Primary 2 Mathematics curriculum.

**2. Mathematics Buddy Programme**

Mathematics Buddy Programme is a partnership between Si Ling Primary and Woodgrove Secondary.Â  Secondary 2 students from Woodgrove Secondary serve as buddies to our P6 pupils who need additional support in mastering mathematical concepts and skills in this weekly programme.
