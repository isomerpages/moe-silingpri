### P.A.L.M. Play and Learn Math

When am I ever going to use Math?

Students often wonder if, when, and how they will ever use Math in "real life" situations.

The truth is that we use Math all the time!

Learning Math in Si Ling Pri goes beyond pen-and-paper drills.  Our students get to enjoy the school-wide Math Fun Week, and Learning Journeys, as well as through mini projects, and the level-specific activities carefully designed to engage each cohort.  In all these exciting experiences, students really get to play and learn Math in new and fun ways!

**Math Fun Week**

Students get to indulge in learning experiences that are enjoyable and fun, both in the classrooms and during recess! They get to have fun while applying what they have learnt! As an extension, we integrate Art and Math and get students to design zentangles, fold origami and make animals using shapes and submit them via SLS.

**Learning Journeys**
Learning journeys encourage students to learn not only through the classroom but also through experiential learning, giving them a breather from their academic routine . Some of these Learning Journeys are also designed with cross-disciplinary learning objectives, for example, students get to learn about Math and Science.

**Mini Projects**
In Si Ling, we provide opportunities for students to participate in mini projects that get them to apply their Mathematical thinking, reasoning and problem-solving skills in some of their real-life activities.

**Learning through Play at Primary one to Primary Five**
**Primary One**
In Primary 1, our students are transformed into story writers and have to create stories using addition and subtraction concepts which they have learnt. Be amazed by the lovely stories they created.

**Primary Two**
What better ways of introducing our Primary 2 students to mass and volume by getting them to make their own dough for baking!

**Primary Three**
A learning journey to the Zoo is what many students look forward to when they are in Primary 3. Before the trip, we get them to write an itinerary on the places they would like to visit with some descriptions on the endangered spices they could find there.

**Primary Four**
Short of Math games to engage the students? Let our Primary 4 students use their creativity to design new Math games using the Mathematical concepts they have learnt. They will never be bored again!

**Primary Five**
What happens when a friend misses the Math lesson? No fear. Our Primary 5 students are here to the rescue. They will be making a video, poster or Powerpoint presentation to teach their friend what they have missed.
