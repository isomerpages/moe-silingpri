### PAL (Programme for Active Learning)

At Si Ling Primary School, all Primary 1 and 2 students participate in Programme for Active (PAL). It provides an avenue for the teachers to nurture the students’ natural desire to learn, to be engaged in and experience the **joy of learning**.   

It comprises six modules of activities in four areas, Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts (Music, Dance, Drama) and Visual Arts, which are carried out during school hours. 

PAL help in the **development of soft skills** in our students such as the ability to communicate with confidence their thoughts and feelings, and having a lively curiosity to be self-directed learners and show resilience when engaging in tasks with challenges.

 Students are also given opportunities in the **development of social skills** such as how to better relate to and work with others from different backgrounds. In a nutshell, PAL helps to equip our students with skills, learning dispositions and knowledge to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised world.
