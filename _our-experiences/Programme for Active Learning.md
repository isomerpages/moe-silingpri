### PAL (Programme for Active Learning)

At Si Ling Primary School, all Primary 1 and 2 students participate in Programme for Active (PAL). It provides an avenue for the teachers to nurture the students’ natural desire to learn, to be engaged in and experience the&nbsp;**joy of learning**.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It comprises six modules of activities in four areas, Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts (Music, Dance, Drama) and Visual Arts, which are carried out during school hours.&nbsp;

PAL help in the&nbsp;**development of soft skills**&nbsp;in our students such as the ability to communicate with confidence their thoughts and feelings, and having a lively curiosity to be self-directed learners and show resilience when engaging in tasks with challenges.

&nbsp;Students are also given opportunities in the&nbsp;**development of social skills**&nbsp;such as how to better relate to and work with others from different backgrounds. In a nutshell, PAL helps to equip our students with skills, learning dispositions and knowledge to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised world.
