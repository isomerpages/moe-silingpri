### Performing Arts

#### "The making of an artist is more than the training of hands; it's the training of the eye, the ear, and the listening heart."

\- William Gough (Writer, Publisher, Director and Artist)

In Si Ling, choir members will learn singing skills such as voice projection and pitching, be exposed to a repertoire of songs, and develop an appreciation for choral music. Choir members also perform and showcase what they have learn on various platforms, such as Open House Day, National Day and Recognition Day concerts, Singapore Youth Festival, VIA @ NTUC Active Ageing and Woodgrove National Day Observance Dinner. 

Through these activities, our members build self-confidence, learn about commitment and teamwork, and foster strong relationships with their choir-mates and teachers-in-charge. Woodgrove National Day Celebration Dinner

The Dance CCA aspires to groom and bring out the best in each pupil in the area of performing arts. Through dance, pupils learn the skills of coordination, flexibility and sense of rhythm.   

In the process of practicing and performing together, our pupils also learn the importance of discipline, teamwork and perseverance as they strive to do their best in their performances.

The Si Ling Guitar Ensemble, led by instructor Mr Oilver Chan, is a vibrant part of our performing arts CCAs. Our aim is to build on music fundamentals, learn guitar techniques, perform as an ensemble and have fun while doing it. 

We play a variety of genres of music from pop songs such as Faded to classical pieces such as Ainsty Suite. In 2018, we took part in our first SYF presentation and came away with a certificate of accomplishment.
