#### Basketball (Girls)

Basketball Girls CCA trains female pupils in basketball skills such as dribbling, passing, shooting, lay up, etc. These skills are more in depth than similar skills they learn in their PE lessons. Strategies for games such as attacking and defending are taught to the pupils as well. Pupils who are good could be chosen as school team to represent the school in National School Games Competitions.

**Achievements:** 

*   **Champion in Tier 2 Competition in National School Games 2019**

*   Our school sent a team of Senior Girls and a team of Junior Girls for the National School Games Competition in 2019.  The Junior Girls team did our school proud by becoming the Champion in the Tier 2 Competition.

**Teachers-in-charge:** Dennis Tuan, Emilia Bte Razali, Goh Lee Teng
