### Values in Action

**Primary 3 VIA – Cleanliness Appreciation Day**  
  
Pupils  learn to appreciate our school cleaners’ contributions and thank them for always being there to take care of our school and well being. They design design a Thank You card or a 3D model to show our appreciation to our school cleaners.

**Primary 4 VIA – Showing our Appreciation to Non- Teaching Staff**   
  
As part of our Values-in-Action, the Primary 4 pupils are involved in a project by showing their appreciation to our Non-Teaching Staff this year. The staffs include the admin, ICT, SPE, librarian, canteen vendors, security guards and dental therapist.   
  
The objective of our project is to understand their dedication and sacrifices serving the school, know them by their names and job designations and to thank them for their great work in ensuring that the school is a better place to be.   
  
Pupils made them appreciation cards and presented to them.   
  
During the recess, the pupils were encouraged to take part in the planned activities/games such as “Match the Staff to Their Names and Jobs” at the game corner and win attractive prizes like ice cream stick bookmarks, which were specially handcrafted by the Friend of Singa Ambassadors. 
  
Pupils were also encouraged to write “Thank You” note at the appreciation corner.   
  
**Primary 5 Values-In-Action**  
  

SLPS Primary 5 students and staff embarked on a Values-In-Action (VIA) project to write notes of appreciation and encouragement to doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers of the University Surgical Cluster Clinics (NUH).  This project provides opportunities for our students to display their gratitude and appreciation to the community.

Together with halal snacks procured by the school, these were delivered to NUH for the doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers.
