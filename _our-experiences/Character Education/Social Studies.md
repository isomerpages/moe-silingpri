### Social Studies

**FBL to Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden- Primary One**

The Primary One pupils went for their Field Based Learning to Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden (JBCG). It gave pupils the opportunity to have hands-on experience of the various types of plant life in Singapore. It was a unique experience for them to look closely and touch, feel as well as smell the various plants and parts of the plants.

First, the pupils had picnic by the lake, near the Botanical Gardens. They brought their own picnic mats and sat on it. They had their snacks and drinks and also enjoyed the beautiful view.

Next, they went to explore JBCG. The pupils were particularly excited about how the different spice and herb plants smelled like. They also had an opportunity to explore plants that grow in water and how the plant parts have adapted themselves according to their surroundings.

Our pupils had fun doing tree bark rubbing, exploring a maze, walking on suspension bridge, hearing echos in a man-made cave and visited a Treehouse too! This is one memorable interactive learning experience for our young ones!

**FBL to Singapore Philatelic Museum – Primary Two**

Our Primary 2 pupils went to the Singapore Philatelic Museum (SPM) as part of their Social Studies field based trip. The objectives are to recognise that common Identity, shared experiences and values unite different races in Singapore; and appreciate different customs and traditions that are practiced by the diverse communities in Singapore.

The pupils had the opportunity to go into various rooms to learn more about the origins of stamps, the representation of stamps from different countries as well as the continents of the world on the 3D World Map.

Pupils also went through a heritage trail where they learned about the customs and cultures of different races through the exhibits and artefacts that were displayed. At the end of the learning journey, students learned to appreciate the customs and traditions practised by the diverse communities in Singapore.
