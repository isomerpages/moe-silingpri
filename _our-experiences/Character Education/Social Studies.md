### Social Studies

**FBL to Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden- Primary One**

The Primary One pupils went for their Field Based Learning to Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden (JBCG). It gave pupils the opportunity to have hands-on experience of the various types of plant life in Singapore. It was a unique experience for them to look closely and touch, feel as well as smell the various plants and parts of the plants.

First, the pupils had picnic by the lake, near the Botanical Gardens. They brought their own picnic mats and sat on it. They had their snacks and drinks and also enjoyed the beautiful view.

Next, they went to explore JBCG. The pupils were particularly excited about how the different spice and herb plants smelled like. They also had an opportunity to explore plants that grow in water and how the plant parts have adapted themselves according to their surroundings.

Our pupils had fun doing tree bark rubbing, exploring a maze, walking on suspension bridge, hearing echos in a man-made cave and visited a Treehouse too! This is one memorable interactive learning experience for our young ones!
