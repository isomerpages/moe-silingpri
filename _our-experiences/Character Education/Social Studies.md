### Social Studies

**FBL to Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden- Primary One**

The Primary One pupils went for their Field Based Learning to Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden (JBCG). It gave pupils the opportunity to have hands-on experience of the various types of plant life in Singapore. It was a unique experience for them to look closely and touch, feel as well as smell the various plants and parts of the plants.

First, the pupils had picnic by the lake, near the Botanical Gardens. They brought their own picnic mats and sat on it. They had their snacks and drinks and also enjoyed the beautiful view.

Next, they went to explore JBCG. The pupils were particularly excited about how the different spice and herb plants smelled like. They also had an opportunity to explore plants that grow in water and how the plant parts have adapted themselves according to their surroundings.

Our pupils had fun doing tree bark rubbing, exploring a maze, walking on suspension bridge, hearing echos in a man-made cave and visited a Treehouse too! This is one memorable interactive learning experience for our young ones!

The pupils had the opportunity to go into various rooms to learn more about the origins of stamps, the representation of stamps from different countries as well as the continents of the world on the 3D World Map.

Pupils also went through a heritage trail where they learned about the customs and cultures of different races through the exhibits and artefacts that were displayed. At the end of the learning journey, students learned to appreciate the customs and traditions practised by the diverse communities in Singapore.

**FBL to** **to interactive Heritage Trail – Primary Five**  
  

Our Primary Five pupils went on an interactive Heritage Trail as part of their Social Studies field-based learning. Using ‘Jigsaw Strategy’, each class was split into three teams to explore and experience Kampong Glam, Little India and Chinatown simultaneously. Pupils were given the opportunity to make explicit meaningful connections between classroom experiences and the environment, using the affordances of wireless and mobile technologies. 

At the end of the trail, the pupils returned to their class to share with their peers on the cultural and practices that they have learnt at each site. By engaging their senses of sight, touch and hearing through the trail, we hope the pupils can foster a greater sense of pride and belonging to our rich Singapore heritage.

**FBL to Singapore Botanical Gardens – Primary Six**

Our Primary Six pupils went for an experiential learning journey to Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG) as part of their Social Studies field-based learning. Pupils are able to learn more about crops grown in Southeast Asia and how Singapore is connected to the rest of Southeast Asia through the Heritage Museum and the heritage trees found in the gardens.

There are also opportunities to interact with the exhibits in the Heritage Museum and find out the origins of key economic crops grown for food and commercial purposes in Southeast Asia. Pupils will learn that the growing of these economic crops, an important economic activity has helped to contribute to a strong and prosperous Southeast Asia. Pupils will also be encouraged to observe, reflect and deepen their own personal understanding as they immerse themselves in the multi-sensory environment.
