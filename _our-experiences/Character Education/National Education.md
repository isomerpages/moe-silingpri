**National Education (NE)**

In Si Ling Primary School, we believe in active citizenship among our students. As such, National Education (NE) allow our students to explore and examine their identity as citizens in relation to society and the world, and arrive at a common set of ideals and values.

There will be four NE Commemorative Days that we commemorate in Si Ling Primary School; Total Defence Day (TDD), International Friendship Day (IFD), Racial Harmony Day (RHD) and National Day. For each commemorative day, there will be customize learning activities and follow up programmes. 

  

As for a cohort experience, it ranges from the Museum-based Learning programme for Primary 4 students with specific connections to Social Studies and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Primary 5 NE Show and NE Quiz for our Primary 6 students.

  

#### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)

Si Ling Primary school’s vision of ‘**Every Si Ling pupil a scholar who Leads and Serves**’ are premised on CCE core values of **R**espect, **R**esponsibility, **R**esilience, **I**ntegrity, **C**are and **H**armony. This is to provide a holistic experiences for the physical, leadership, social and moral development of our students for the betterment of self and society. 

With this integration, the learning of CCE are infused across our different existing programes , such as Civics and Moral Education (CME), National Education (NE), Cyber Wellness, Sexuality Education, Education Career Guidance (ECG) and Values In Action (VIA).  

**Total Defence Day**

Si Ling Primary School commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) to renew our commitment to keep Singapore safe and strong. The theme for TDD is **Together We Keep Singapore Strong**. The TDD’s special assembly programme showcased our very own teachers, Mr Johan and Mr Hilmi, sharing their National Service (NS) experiences while wearing their respective NS uniforms.
