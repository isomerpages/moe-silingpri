### Learning for Life Programme

**LLP: Community and Student Leadership**

The school’s LLP programme on Community and Student Leadership sees an integration of student leadership in the community – beginning with self and family, through our school’s key programmes.

**LLP Outcomes:**

1.  Equip students with leadership skills and qualities that are in line with the school’s values through explicit teaching or teachable moments during curriculum
2.  Provide students with the opportunities to apply these skills and qualities in the different levels of their community (self-family-school-outside community)
3.  Instill in students a heart to serve the community

It provides the opportunity for different groups of students to reach out to the external community through our outreach programmes.

**Primary 1 and 2 - Self and Family**

Students learn to take self-responsibility and to serve others – especially their elders, at home.
