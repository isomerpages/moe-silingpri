### **Student Leadership**

In line with our school’s vision –&nbsp;**Every Si Ling Student a Scholar who Leads and Serves**, our school places a strong emphasis to develop every Si Ling pupil with the relevant leadership skills to lead oneself as well as others based on their leadership aptitude and interests.

##### Level 1: Self Leadership

All Si Ling students learn self-leadership skills through our ‘Leaders of Self’ (LoS) Series during Assembly to be equipped as Level 1 ‘Leaders of Self and Values’ and Peer Supporters.

##### Level 2: Basic Leadership

Our Level 2 task-specific Student Leaders are selected and trained on their task-specific roles by the respective teachers-in-charge to build on their basic leadership skills. For instance, the Class Monitors and ICT monitors are trained by the Student Leadership Committee and ICT department respectively. All other class operations monitors are trained by their subject teachers with the use of the school’s ‘Guide for Classroom Leadership’. To encourage more opportunities for all pupils, these Level 2 leadership roles are rotated either termly or semestrally.

##### Level 3: Advanced Leadership

All Level 3 Student leaders are trained by the Student Leadership Committee to hone their advanced leadership skills. A selected group of these Student Leaders form the ‘Special-Projects Committee’ where they take charge of the planning and execution of student-led activities like the Students’ Voice Online Forum and Students’ Suggestion Scheme (SSS). They also assist in school-level programmes like the planning of Teachers’ Day.

##### Level 4: Outstanding Leadership

Besides undergoing the same training sessions as the Level 3 Student Leaders, our Level 4 Student Leaders also go through basic mentoring sessions to further hone their outstanding leadership skills. This also guides them to be positive influence and mentors to other students and Student Leaders under their charge.
