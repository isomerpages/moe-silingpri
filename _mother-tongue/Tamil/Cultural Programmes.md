<p>Every year, it is customary for the school to hold a Pongal celebration.
The aim is to teach our Indian students the background and significance
of celebrating the Pongal festival. Items related to Pongal are displayed
in the classroom. Competitions related to Pongal are conducted for the
students. The students enthusiastically participate in activities such
as colouring, making greeting cards, and creating e- Pongal advertisements.</p>
