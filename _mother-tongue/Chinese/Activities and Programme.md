<h3>Activities and Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong>
<br>To cultivate students’ reading habits and strengthen their listening,
speaking, reading, and writing competencies through sustained reading practices.</p>
<p>The Chinese Department has developed a structured and comprehensive reading
programme, as outlined below:</p>
<p>At the lower levels, teachers guide students in reading picture books
and support their understanding of texts through scaffolded reading activities.
At the middle levels, teachers facilitate the development of higher-order
thinking skills and model good reading practices through silent reading.
At the upper levels, students engage in independent reading and further
develop higher-order thinking skills through reflection and sharing of
reading responses.</p>

<p><strong>Engaging Classroom Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Through engaging and enjoyable classroom activities, students’ interest
in learning is heightened and their thinking is stimulated, motivating
them to participate actively in the learning process. In a relaxed and
supportive classroom environment, students are able to experience the joy
of learning and gradually achieve their learning objectives step by step.</p>

<p><strong>iPad-Assisted Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance students’ motivation to learn, our school implemented an iPad-assisted
learning programme for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students. Through one-to-one
access to digital devices, technology is integrated into classroom learning
to support instruction. This has greatly increased students’ engagement
and enthusiasm, allowing them to participate actively and confidently in
Chinese language lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Support Packages</strong>
</p>
<p>To better reinforce key learning points taught in class, school-based
learning support packages are provided at every <s>grade</s> level. These
resources effectively integrate the four key language components—listening,
speaking, reading, and writing—allowing students ample opportunities to
practise listening and speaking while ensuring that reading and writing
skills are developed in tandem. Through a structured and progressive approach,
the packages support students’ learning and help them achieve the overall
learning objectives.</p>
