<p><strong>Chinese Language Department</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum Focus</strong>
</p>
<p>Aligned with the Ministry of Education (MOE) Chinese Language Syllabus,
the Chinese Language Department implements a coherent and progressive curriculum
from Primary 1 to Primary 6, designed to meet students’ learning needs.
The curriculum emphasises the integrated development of the four language
skills — Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing, recognising that effective
language learning occurs through the concurrent application of these skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Listening and Speaking</p>
<p>Primary 1 to Primary 4:
<br>Instruction is closely aligned with the prescribed textbooks and curriculum
materials. A range of structured listening and speaking activities, including
guided oral practice, situational role-play and songs, are incorporated
to support students’ early language development.</p>
<p>Primary 5 to Primary 6:
<br>Learning is organised around thematic units, supported by targeted instructional
resources. The 5W1H framework is employed to engage students actively in
learning and to strengthen their confidence and competence in using Mandarin
for purposeful communication.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>It is widely recognised that language learning is closely linked to reading.
To spark students’ interest in learning Chinese Language and to cultivate
the habit of reading Chinese storybooks, the Chinese Language Department
has developed a comprehensive and structured reading programme. Through
sustained engagement with age-appropriate texts, students are able to benefit
meaningfully in their overall Chinese Language learning.</p>
<p>In addition, students at the&nbsp;lower primary levels&nbsp;participate
in the Ministry of Education’s&nbsp;Mother Tongue Language SOAR Programme&nbsp;(“Spark
Interest, Open Minds, Appreciate Cultural Roots, Rise as a Bilingual Reader”).
This programme aims to nurture students’ interest in reading, broaden their
perspectives, deepen their appreciation of cultural roots, and develop
them into confident bilingual readers.</p>

<p><strong>Writing Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing instruction adopts a progressive and scaffolded
approach, guiding students step by step from sentence writing to&nbsp;paragraph
writing, and eventually to&nbsp;<s>extended </s>compositions.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;5W1H&nbsp;writing strategy is consistently
applied across all levels to help students organise ideas and express themselves
clearly and effectively.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Differentiated teaching strategies are implemented
across the&nbsp;lower, middle, and upper primary levels&nbsp;to cater to
students’ varying abilities and learning needs.</p>
