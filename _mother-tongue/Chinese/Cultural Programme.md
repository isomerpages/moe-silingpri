<h3>Cultural Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Chinese New Year</strong>
</p>
<p>As the Lunar New Year drew near, excitement filled the classrooms as students
and staff eagerly anticipated Si Ling Primary School’s annual Chinese New
Year celebration. The school was transformed with vibrant decorations,
creating a festive and cheerful atmosphere throughout the campus. A series
of lively performances lit up the celebration, showcasing students’ talents
and energy, followed by a delightful surprise finale dance by the teachers.
Laughter, applause, and smiles filled the air as the entire school community
came together to celebrate the joy and traditions of the Lunar New Year.</p>

<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong>
</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Ministry of Education’s Mother Tongue Fortnight
initiative, the Chinese Language Department organised a series of engaging
and meaningful activities to spark students’ interest in learning their
Mother Tongue and to deepen their appreciation of Chinese culture. Students
were also encouraged to take part in activities with their family members
or share newly acquired cultural and artistic experiences at home. These
efforts helped strengthen parent-child bonds while creating more opportunities
for students to use Mandarin confidently in their daily lives.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong>
</p>
<p>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) provides funding for schools
to bring students beyond the classroom to experience Mandarin-based cultural
and artistic works in professional performance venues. Through exposure
to a wide range of rich and diverse cultural performances, students are
able to appreciate the beauty and depth of Chinese culture. The programme
also aims to nurture a love for learning Chinese from a young age, planting
the seeds of lifelong enjoyment and appreciation of the language and its
arts.</p>
