SLPS is a school that has developed me in my studies. Everyone is helpful and kind so I really enjoyed going to this school. Other then that, the school has great values that has made me into a better person. Teachers in the school are also very helpful and experienced, so the students are in good hands. I am very grateful for the school, a warm place I called home."

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude towards all my teachers who had taught me. Especially to Mr Teo, Mrs Tan, Cikgu Fara and Mr Ashri, who had been guiding me through my final years in Si Ling. Lastly, Mrs Tang, the very first teacher who taught me in this school. Before I end, I would like to wish all the primary 6 students of 2020 good luck and all the best for their PSLE. Have fun. Enjoy your final year here with your friends but stay focused.”

One of my favourite was the young entrepreneur event held while I was in Primary 6. We designed our own games, planned and set up game booths for our juniors and kindergarten kids to play. We had lots of fun and learned much from the event as well.”
