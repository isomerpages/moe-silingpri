### 2016 Graduates

#### Matthew Yeo
**Current School: NUS High School of Mathematics and Science**

The school has many caring and supportive teachers who would guide you along the way. I had leadership opportunities in the school, for example, as a prefect, I learnt the basics of being a leader and this has served as a stepping stone for my leadership role in NUS High School.”

#### Isha Chandra Gowda
**Current School: St Margaret’s Secondary School**
<img src="/images/at25.png" style="width:180px;height:180px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> “The dedicated and caring teachers at Si Ling Primary School have really helped me grow as a person academically and morally. They have always emphasised on the importance of right moral values and how to be a person with integrity and respect for others. My entire primary school experience was well-rounded and I couldn't be more proud to say I was a student of SLPS. Certainly, Si Ling has changed my life and I cannot thank the teachers enough for their unconditional love, care and support for an amazing six years. Thank you, SLPS!"
