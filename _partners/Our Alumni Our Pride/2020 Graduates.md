It was where I learnt that our academic abilities do not define us - our values are important too. SLPS was like a second home to me, and the teachers were like our parents - always giving their 110% no matter what. I would love to give back to my alma mater one day! Thank you, all my wonderful teachers who had taught me in my years in Si Ling Primary School!"

#### Teo Hong Yan
**Current School: Evergreen Secondary School**

<img src="/images/at8.png" style="width:180px;height:180px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> “I am proud to be one of the alumni of Si Ling Primary School (SLPS). The Si Ling S.P.I.R.I.T and the school programmes developed my moral values. Not only that, teachers in SLPS are very encouraging and always put in the extra effort into teaching and helping us to understand. I&nbsp;&nbsp;remember how our mornings were always of our form teachers sitting with us clarifying our doubts or just spent getting to know us better. I also had a lot of leadership opportunities in SLPS that helped students like me in building leadership skills. To sum it all up, I enjoyed my SLPS experience and it definitely has played a part in shaping who I am today. Thank you, SLPS!"

They had lots of enrichment programmes like the Math Olympiad, the Science Enrichment… it helped me to further my studies, broaden my knowledge and I grew more love for the subjects as I understood them better."

I had wonderful friends who were more than willing to help me when I needed it. In SLPS, there are encouraging and caring teachers too. I remember how in P6, my teachers would always tell us stories to encourage and motivate us to do our best for PSLE. In SLPS, I also had many leadership opportunities to build up on my leadership abilities. Overall, it was a pleasure studying in SLPS."
