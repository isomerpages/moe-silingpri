<img align="left" style="width:200px;margin-right:15px" src="/images/Gan_Jin.png"> For example, as part of Post PSLE activities, we went to Singapore Botanic Garden. It was an enriching learning journey. I have a lot of friends in Si Ling Primary and I'm still in contact with many of them. My proudest moment was at the End of Year Recognition Day. I was awarded for doing well in my academics. Si Ling Primary provided me with a lot of opportunities to express myself. I was given the opportunities to represent the school in the SYF competition and Math Olympiad Competition. I am truly appreciative of the experience. One defining moment that I will never forget when I was awarded the Silver award in the APMOS Math Olympiad competition. I thought that I may aim for a mathematics related path in the future. There were plenty of beautiful memories that I had in Si Ling Primary. I enjoyed the class bonding sessions with the Form Teachers and the School Leaders. One of the teachers who Aw  supported me a lot in academics as well as in my mental well-being was Miss Aw Jie Shi. She dedicated her time and effort to all of us in our final two years. To all the staff and students in Si Ling Primary, I encourage each of you to overcome the  challenges and obstacles, be positive and continue striving for excellence.

<img align="left" style="width:200px;margin-right:15px" src="/images/Nur_Aqidah.png">My experience as a student in Si Ling was amazing! I was given plenty of opportunities to serve my role as a student and with the help of my teachers, I even got the opportunity to become a prefect which had also provided me with many achievements. I was also surrounded by dedicated teachers who guided me to where I am now, they had also made my experience in Si Ling fun, and to my friends that I made in Si Ling, they supported me through my obstacles. I am still in contact with those friends, some are in the same school as me and as for the others from different schools we would find time to meet up and update each other. 

My proudest moment in Si Ling would be when I received many awards, as I got to make my teachers, parents and myself proud. Opportunities that Si Ling provided me with to develop myself was the young entrepreneur and the visit to the old folks

Beautiful memories I had in Si Ling was two Minutes of fame, personally I dislike dancing but two of my closest friends had convinced me to join them which I do not have regrets on as I had so much fun during the times we would stay back to practice, we would also practice with other friends who were also participating in the event, sometimes all of us would even start role playing as a joke.

Personally for me I cannot pick only one teacher as all my teachers had motivated me to finish my Primary school, and no words can describe how grateful I am.

Finally, my message to both staff and current students at the school is to never give up, it may be the most common phrase but definitely the most impactful. In life there will definitely be obstacles to overcome, just know develop success from failures. Importantly it is the number of times you bounce back up. I believe if I can do it you can too but better. I want to wish all the best in your journey in Si Ling. Thank you all for listening hope to see all of you soon!
