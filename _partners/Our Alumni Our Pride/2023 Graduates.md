"Si Ling Primary provided me with a lot of opportunities to express myself. I was given the opportunities to represent the school in the SYF competition and Math Olympiad Competition. I am truly appreciative of the experience.

One defining moment that I will never forget when I was awarded the Silver award in the APMOS Math Olympiad competition. I thought that I may aim for a mathematics related path in the future. There were plenty of beautiful memories that I had in Si Ling Primary. I enjoyed the class bonding sessions with the Form Teachers and the School Leaders."

"My proudest moment in Si Ling would be when I received many awards, as I got to make my teachers, parents and myself proud. Opportunities that Si Ling provided me with to develop myself was the young entrepreneur and the visit to the old folks"
