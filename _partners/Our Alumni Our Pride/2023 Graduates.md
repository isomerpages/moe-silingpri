" One defining moment that I will never forget when I was awarded the Silver award in the APMOS Math Olympiad competition. I thought that I may aim for a mathematics related path in the future. There were plenty of beautiful memories that I had in Si Ling Primary. I enjoyed the class bonding sessions with the Form Teachers and the School Leaders."

"My proudest moment in Si Ling would be when I received many awards, as I got to make my teachers, parents and myself proud. Opportunities that Si Ling provided me with to develop myself was the young entrepreneur and the visit to the old folks"

##### Anne Ujjwal Chowdary

**Current School: &nbsp;Victoria School**

<img align="left" style="width:200px;margin-right:15px" src="/images/Anne_Ujjwal.png">"Si Ling Primary provided me with so many opportunities to improve myself. I could freely ask the teachers any external questions from the questions they teach in class, and the school library is very easily accessible, so I could research on any topic or even relax for a bit while reading the comics they provide in the library, which is super engaging and informative.

##### Maria Dabus Davinsa Danggus 

**Current School: &nbsp;Marsiling Secondary School**

<img align="left" style="width:200px;margin-right:15px" src="/images/Maria.png">" In Si Ling, I have achieved many things with the support of my peers and teachers. One of the achievements I have received was getting the Distinction Award in leadership since that represents me as a student. 

Without the help of my teachers, countless support from the people I love and the confidence that I have built in myself, I probably would not have gotten that precious award of mine. Si Ling Primary is a school filled with a large group of people you can count on and call them family. The teachers and student leaders work together to give opportunities for everyone to grow.
