<h3>Parents in Partnership</h3>
<p><strong>PARENTS AS PARTNERS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building a strong home-school partnership is instrumental in the holistic
growth and development of a child. In Si Ling Primary School, we feel that
it is important for parents to be equipped with the necessary parenting
skills. To cater to the different parents’ needs, we invited speakers to
share with parents on the different aspect of parenting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school also organizes parent –child bonding sessions which allow both
the parents and children a chance to work together, understand and communicate
effectively through fun and meaningful activities.</p>
<p>Feedback from parents shows that parents were deeply appreciative of these
parenting workshops and bonding activities as they have helped them become
more confident in supporting and guiding their children. Below are some
snapshots of activities for our parents and children.</p>

<p><strong>SUPPORT FROM PARENT VOLUNTEERS</strong>
</p>
<p>Si Ling Primary has a group of very dedicated parent volunteers who work
closely with the school on many of its department programmes and events.
Our parent volunteers were involved in school events like Total Defence
Day, Mother Tongue Fortnight&nbsp; Week , Racial Harmony Day, International
Friendship&nbsp; Day, Teachers’ Day Gift making, Children’s Day celebration
and many others. Thank you parents for your unwavering support! Below are
some snapshots of activities in which our parent volunteers rendered their
services to the school.</p>
<p>It takes a village to raise a child. Parents, if you are interested to
join us as a parent volunteer, do complete this online&nbsp;<a href="https://form.gov.sg/6624e64156239c7f77c2862d" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">form</a>&nbsp;.
