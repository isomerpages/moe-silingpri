### Parents in Partnership

**PARENTS AS PARTNERS**&nbsp;

Building a strong home-school partnership is instrumental in the holistic growth and development of a child. In Si Ling Primary School, we feel that it is important for parents to be equipped with the necessary parenting skills. To cater to the different parents’ needs, we invited speakers to share with parents on the different aspect of parenting.&nbsp;

The school also organizes parent –child bonding sessions which allow both the parents and children a chance to work together, understand and communicate effectively through fun and meaningful activities.

Feedback from parents shows that parents were deeply appreciative of these parenting workshops and bonding activities as they have helped them become more confident in supporting and guiding their children. Below are some snapshots of activities for our parents and children.

**SUPPORT FROM PARENT VOLUNTEERS**  

Si Ling Primary has a group of very dedicated parent volunteers who work closely with the school on many of its department programmes and events. Our parent volunteers were involved in school events like Total Defence Day, Mother Tongue Fortnight&nbsp; Week , Racial Harmony Day, International Friendship&nbsp; Day, Teachers’ Day Gift making, Children’s Day celebration and many others. Thank you parents for your unwavering support! Below are some snapshots of activities in which our parent volunteers rendered their services to the school.

It takes a village to raise a child. Parents, if you are interested to join us as a parent volunteer, do complete this online&nbsp;[form](https://go.gov.sg/f4flpk)&nbsp;. Our teacher-in-charge will contact you on this.
