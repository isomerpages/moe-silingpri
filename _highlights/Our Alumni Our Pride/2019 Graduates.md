From extremely friendly, dedicated and caring teachers, to my amazing friends and the conducive environment provided for all students, I certainly do not regret being a student of Si Ling Primary. I was always able to showcase my talents during CCA and out of CCA too. I was given many opportunities to show leadership and also to learn new things. Si Ling Primary also recognized my achievements, which made me all the more determined to excel further in academics and also in other aspects. All in all, I am with no doubt proud to say that I was from Si Ling Primary, a garden where scholars bloom."

One of my favourite was the young entrepreneur event held while I was in Primary 6. We designed our own games, planned and set up game booths for our juniors and kindergarten kids to play. We had lots of fun and learned much from the event as well.”
