The school has many caring teachers who will always encourage you and guide you along the way. I had a wonderful time participating in various bonding activities that the teachers had planned, such as leadership camps, P5 camps and many more. Without the help of the teachers and principal, I would not be where I am now. I want to specially thank them for all of their hard work!”
