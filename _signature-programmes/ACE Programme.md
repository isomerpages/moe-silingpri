### A.C.E. Programme

Always Confident and Enthusiastic (ACE) to achieve our best, is our school signature weekly programme for selected Primary 3 and Primary 4 pupils.  

Through a series of activities and learning experiences, we hope that these pupils would build self-confidence and self-esteem, and crucially encouraging a belief in self-efficacy, ability and resilience to deal with change and adaption. We seek to provide these students with an array of interest domains to explore throughout the year.  Each term is focused on a specific skills-set that the students can pick up through play.  Each term’s activities are supplemented with a similar-themed Learning Journey.
