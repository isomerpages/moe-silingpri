### F.L.Y. Programme

First Love Yourself (F.L.Y) to achieve our best, is our school signature weekly programme for selected Primary 3 and Primary 4 pupils.

Through a series of activities and learning experiences, we hope that these pupils would build self-confidence and self-esteem, and crucially encouraging a belief in self-efficacy, ability and resilience to deal with change and adaption. We seek to provide these students with an array of interest domains to explore throughout the year.&nbsp; Each term is focused on a specific skills-set that the students can pick up through play.&nbsp; Each term’s activities are supplemented with a similar-themed Learning Journey.
