<h3><strong>3H Approach</strong></h3><p>ESP adopts the 3H approach which covers 3 key developmental domains – HEAD (knowledge &amp; skills), HEART (values &amp; emotions) and HANDS (participation &amp; contribution) to develop students who continuously use concepts and integrate skills and processes in inquiring phenomena related to the environment, think creatively and critically in solving environmental problems, communicate and work effectively in teams and have strong conviction in bettering the environment.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/alp3.png"></div><h4>Themes in ESP</h4><p>ESP focuses on five themes.
