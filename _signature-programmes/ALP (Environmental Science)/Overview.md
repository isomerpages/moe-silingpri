At Si Ling Primary School, we aspire to nurture our students to be thinking
learners and gracious citizens, who are able to take on future challenges.
Environmental degradation has become one of the most prominent adverse
phenomenon in today’s world.



We believe that our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Environmental
Science Programme, can educate our future generation on the importance
of environment sustainability and conservation, making them more sensitised
and encouraging them to find innovative solutions and methods to protect
nature.
