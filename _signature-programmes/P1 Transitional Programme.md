### **P1 Transitional Programme**

<img src="/images/transitionalprogramme1.png" style="width:340px;height:250px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">

P1 students do not start their formal curriculum in the first week. They have Orientation Week.

#### Rationale

Having a good transition plan from Kindergarten to Primary One is very important for young children.  When they move from a preschool environment to a primary school, the change is huge.  The changes start with environment and routine; then to intra- and inter-personal relationships. These changes can be overwhelming and daunting for any child.  To help children face these challenges, the framework will enable each Primary One student to adapt to their new environment effectively. A successful transition can have long-term positive outcomes for children both in their educational success and in terms of social and emotional development.

#### Objectives

To help our Primary One cohort transit seamlessly from the Preschool to the Primary School settings.

To enable Primary One students to gain confidence, become competent learners and develop a love for learning.

To instill skills that they can adapt to a new environment.

##### **The 3Cs Approach**

###### **C**ommunication

**1. Care**
Social & Emotional Readiness

When children go through the transition from preschool to primary school, they will experience many changes at several levels:   
• change in the school structure – size of school, subjects, school rules, etc.  
• change in the classroom structure – size of class, seating arrangement,   
   teaching methods, etc.   
• change in relationships – teachers, peers, greater competition, etc  
Good mental wellbeing is a key factor in supporting children in their transition process. Children with good mental wellbeing are likely to be able to navigate their new surroundings with greater ease, and hence adjust better and faster to the new school setting.

**2. Communication**
Effective communication skills build a positive school environment built upon self-awareness. It involves active listening and clear respectful speaking. Effective communication is also key to positive partnership with parents. When teachers and parents share knowledge and experience, it has a positive on the child’s well-being and development.

**3. Collaboration**
Positive collaboration with the different stakeholders help to increase students’ wellbeing and academic achievements. When teachers collaborate with parents and the community, they help to develop the student holistically.

Highlights include bonding games, familiarization tours and setting of routines. We build in our children a sense of belonging and community so that they remain positive and feel secure about their new environment.  

With the above framework in place, we seek to ensure that each child that comes to Si Ling Primary School has a smooth transition in Primary One.
