<h3><strong>Learning for Life Programme(LLP): Student Leadership</strong></h3>
<p>Si Ling Primary School adopts its Leadership Framework from Kouzes and
Posner’s <em>The Leadership Challenge</em>. By understanding the five domains
outlined in the framework, students at SLPS are guided to develop and demonstrate
key leadership traits.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Leadership Framework</strong></h4>
<p>At Si Ling Primary School, we believe that <strong>every student is a leader</strong>.
Our student leadership framework is designed to develop leadership progressively,
allowing students to grow from leading themselves to leading others and
contributing meaningfully to the school community.</p>
<p>Our leadership structure is organised into a <strong>tiered pyramid</strong>,
ensuring that leadership development is inclusive, purposeful, and age-appropriate.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>L1: Leaders of Self and Values</strong></h4>
<p>At the foundation of our framework are <strong>all students</strong>. At
this level, students learn to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Demonstrate responsibility, integrity, and respect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practise self-discipline and positive learning behaviours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support peers as Peer Supporters and Leaders of Self (LoS)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This stage focuses on building strong values and character, forming the
basis of effective leadership.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>L2: Basic Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>Students at this level take on functional leadership roles, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>ICT Monitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class Monitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recycling Monitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operations Monitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer Support Leaders (PSLs)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These roles provide students with opportunities to develop basic leadership
skills, teamwork, and accountability through daily responsibilities.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>L3: Advanced Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>At the advanced level, student leaders take on broader responsibilities
and influence, including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Prefects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCA Leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level Assistant Prefects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environment Ambassadors (EAs)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students learn to lead by example, support school initiatives, and mentor
younger peers while strengthening their communication and organisational
skills.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>L4: Outstanding Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>The highest tier recognises students who demonstrate exemplary leadership
qualities and commitment. Roles include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Head Prefect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assistant Head Prefects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCA Heads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environment Ambassador (EA) Heads</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These leaders work closely with teachers and school leaders, often serving
on <strong>Special Projects Committees</strong>, where they plan and lead
student-initiated projects that contribute to school improvement and community
engagement.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Developing Leaders for Life</strong></h4>
<p>Through this structured and developmental approach, Si Ling Primary School
nurtures confident, values-driven leaders who are prepared to serve, inspire
others, and make a positive difference—both in school and beyond.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Students Voice Forum</strong>
</p>
<p>The Students’ Voice Forum aims to develop student leaders’ 21st Century
Competencies (21CC) in communication, collaboration, and information skills,
as well as civic and cross-cultural literacy. Through managing the entire
process of engaging their peers on school improvement matters, student
leaders learn to listen, reflect, and take action on issues that matter
to their school community.</p>
<p>Each term, all students are invited to provide feedback and suggestions
on various topics related to school life and improvement projects (e.g.,
use of lockers, creation of student spaces) via a student-leader-led online
survey. This is followed by a townhall-style discussion forum, where students
further deliberate on the ideas shared. The Student Leadership Committee,
together with selected student leaders, then reviews the feedback and identifies
feasible suggestions to be implemented in the following term.</p>
<p>In May 2025, the school collaborated with cluster schools — Fuchun, Innova,
and Woodlands Primary Schools — to showcase the implementation of the Students’
Voice initiative. This collaboration provided an opportunity for cluster
schools to learn from SLPS’ experience in infusing 21CC in the LLP, and
explore ways to adapt the initiative in their own contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Kindergarten Outreach (Si Ling School Experience)</strong>
</p>
<p>All Level 3 Student Leaders—including Prefects, CCA Leaders, and Environment
Ambassadors (EAs)—were deployed over three days to welcome kindergarten
students to Si Ling Primary School. Our student leaders took on multiple
roles, such as leading icebreakers, facilitating PAL activities, and guiding
kindergarteners through the sustainability lesson at EcoMart.</p>
<p>A selected group of student leaders also underwent additional training
to serve as school guides for the campus tour. Positive feedback was received
from the visiting kindergartens, participating parents, and our own student
leaders. Through this programme, student leaders developed essential 21st-century
competencies, particularly in collaboration and communication.</p>
