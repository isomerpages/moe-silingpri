#### LLP Outcomes:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc"> 
	<li>Equip students with leadership skills and qualities that are in line with the school’s values through explicit teaching or teachable moments during curriculum</li>
	<img style="width:90%" src="/images/17.png">
	<li>Provide students with the opportunities to apply these skills and qualities in the different levels of their community (self-family-school-outside community) </li>
	<li>Instill in students a heart to serve the community

</ul>
 It provides the opportunity for different groups of students to reach out to the external community through our outreach programmes.
